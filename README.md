# Unix-Team-project: VPS Management

## Objective

This repository aims to teach users of Virtual Private Servers. From description all the way to set up and management. The aim is to guide the user on what every step will be like.

## What is a VPS?

A VPS server is similar to a regular server, running its own OS (Operating system, like Windows/Mac OSX/Linux). However, unlike a regular server, A VPS (Virtual Private Server) is like a partition of the regular server, so many people can use the server, except your data is kept privately to yourself/admin. It can run almost all applications that are made for that OS. 

## What are its uses and benefits? 

### Uses 

- Running a website
- Run a filestore/FTP server
- Cloud File Storage System
- Video game servers
- Media servers

Of course, they can be used for much more so do look around the wide web for projects that might interest you.

### Benefits

- The next logical step after shared hosting for their website; A VPS is more powerful and flexible and more suitable for high traffic websites
- You can install whatever you want (more so in hypervisor type VMs like Xen)
- Cheaper than a dedicated server while providing the same general applications
- More secure than a shared host
- More powerful then a shared host
